# YouTube Assistent âˆ’ Additional features, Ad Blocker and keyboard shortcuts for YouTube.

This userscript adds support for additional features and keyboard shortucts. It also blocks (most) ads and trackers.
See complete list of features and keyboard shortcuts below.
NOTE: YouTube Assistent derived from [Stream Assistent](https://github.com/CHJ85/Stream-Assistent), which supports a long list of streaming services.

# Keyboard shortcuts
 - Ctrl+Up - Enable surround sound (unable to turn off without having to refresh the webpage)
 - Ctrl+Right - Jump forward 30 seconds. Useful for skipping the TV show intro or if you just want to fast forward a bit (works on ads too).
 - Ctrl+Down - Video filters: black & white, sepia and invert colors
 - Ctrl+, - Hue color control
# Additional Features
 - Block ads and trackers by toggling the red "ads" button on/off
 - Change aspect ratio directly from the video player
 - Control brightness from the video player's setting menu
 - Additional speed options have been added under "Playback speed"
# Ad blocking
This script uses a blacklist of ad domains in order to block ads. So it is important that you turn off the ad blocker and allow ads in every once in awhile for caching.
And the script will block 95% of all video ads and trackers when the "ad" button is set to "Block Ads". 
# Installation
To use the script:
 - Install a userscript manager extension like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).
