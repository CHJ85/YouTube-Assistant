# YouTube Assistent âˆ’ Additional features, keyboard shortcuts and tracker blocking for YouTube.

This userscript adds support for additional features and keyboard shortucts. It also blocks (most) trackers.
See complete list of features and keyboard shortcuts below.
NOTE: YouTube Assistent derived from [Stream Assistent](https://github.com/CHJ85/Stream-Assistent), which supports a long list of streaming services.

# Keyboard shortcuts
 - Ctrl+Up - Enable surround sound (unable to turn off without having to refresh the webpage)
 - Ctrl+Left - Hue color control
 - Ctrl+Right - Jump forward 30 seconds. Useful for skipping the TV show intro or if you just want to fast forward a bit.
 - Ctrl+Down - Video filters: black & white, sepia and invert colors
# Additional Features
 - Change aspect ratio directly from the video player
 - Control brightness from the video player's setting menu
 - Additional speed options have been added under "Playback speed"
# Ad blocking
This script no longer contains an ad blocker. I've made a separate script for this purpose, called [YouTube AdBlock](https://github.com/CHJ85/YT-AdBlock). 
# Installation
To use the script:
 - Install a userscript manager extension like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).
 - Install the [script](https://github.com/chj85/YouTube-Assistent/raw/main/main.user.js)
